Hi there, I'm Zack.

I currently lead the [Openverse](/openverse) team at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/), an open source search engine for openly-licensed media.

Previously I wrote more open source software at [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org), an international nonprofit organization dedicated to building and sustaining a thriving commons of shared knowledge and culture.

Before that I worked as a consultant and contributor on various pieces of software at small startups and agencies. I'll write more about that soon.
