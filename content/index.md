Hi there, I'm Zack.

I currently lead a group of developers sponsored by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) to work on [Openverse](/openverse), an open source search engine for openly-licensed media.

Previously I wrote more open source software at [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org), an international nonprofit organization dedicated to building and sustaining a thriving commons of shared knowledge and culture.

Before that I worked as a consultant and contributor on various pieces of software for startups, agencies, and local businesses. I'll write more about that someday.
