You can get in touch with me at [sayhi@zackkrida.com](mailto:sayhi@zackkrida.com). Alternatively check me out on the following code platforms:

- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/zackkrida) ~ I post occasional CSS and JS experiments, little canvas demos, and small code patterns
- [GitHub](https://github.com/zackkrida) ~ Open source projects and libraries. I try to keep things pretty clean, so most code here is pretty representative of my current development approach
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/@zackkrida) ~ More elaborate app demos and code samples. a fantastic home for small live projects
