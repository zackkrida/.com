I currently work directly with a number of clients, often as a solo developer and architect of projects, but also as part of existing development teams.
Most of my work covers the following areas:

- **Full-stack TypeScript monorepos** containing front-end applications and back-end microservices that share UI elements and isomorphic logic
- **Design systems/component libraries** using React, Storybook, and various css solutions (CSS Modules, Styled Components, and utility class approaches)
- **3rd-party API Integrations** with existing services like Stripe, QuickBooks Online, Filemaker Pro and other bespoke/legacy systems.

All my code is supported with continuous integration and thoughtful unit+functional/integration tests. I love tools like Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress.
