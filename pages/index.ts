Hi there, I'm Zack! I'm a full-stack developer currently working on projects using TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL,
and Postgres. I am also comfortable, but less happy, in PHP. I got my start in web development from Neopets and
MySpace. After a several year break I came back to software development and have loved it since.

I believe that specific tech stacks and libraries *can* and *should* be learned on the job, when a
use case nessitates them, and prefer to focus on strong fundamentals and principles. I have worked with nearly all
of the contemporary front-end JavaScript frameworks and enjoy them, but also stay aware of the raw browser apis
and language features behind them.

I'm most excited to work on a product team of flexible size and spend my working hours deep in building out
features and fixing bugs.

I have a strong history in hiring and training up Junior developers. I have managed small teams of 3-5
across time zones and locations. I'm a firm believer in hiring people for the skillset you want them to have in
six months' time. Pair programming and collaborative code reviews are two of my favorite tools for working with
other developers.
