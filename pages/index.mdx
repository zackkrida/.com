Hi there, I'm Zack! I'm a person with lots of varied interests. There are so many hours in a day and I try to spend as few as possible on Twitter! I prefer to spend my time eating, drinking, planning things to eat and drink later, and spending time with people I love.

I write software for money and usually enjoy it. I like this quote from Alan J. Perlis in the Forward of the wonderful book _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_:

> "If art interprets our dreams, the computer executes them in the guise of programs!"

I like to write software in JavaScript. It's not the best, or fastest programming language, but it runs in browsers and I like writing it more than PHP, my first programming language. These days I often use TypeScript, when appropriate, along with other tools like GraphQL, Node.js, and Postgres.

I currently write software at [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org), an international nonprofit organization dedicated to building and sustaining a thriving commons of shared knowledge and culture.

Previously, I've worked as a consultant and contributor on various pieces of software. I'll write more about that soon.
