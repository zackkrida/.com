    <p>I am currently employed full-time as a remote software engineer at the Rhode-Island-based TTG, an agency specializing in integrated web applications and digital marketing solutions.</p>
    <p>I spend my days <strong>jumping across the stack</strong>—my average day includes things like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Building an a11y-compliant bulk actions dropdown in React</li>
      <li>Reviewing a junior developer's pull requests on a legacy WordPress site</li>
      <li>Normalizing json data for a client's products from a POS system export</li>
      <li>Auditing front-end performance on one of our in-house CMS systems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I work with a talented and fun team of developers and marketers, but am open to new opportunites on teams that <strong>live and breathe remote</strong>. I'm also looking for a larger team than I'm currently on—and to create more open-source work.</p>
