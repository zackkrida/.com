my personal website.

## principles

- Build process is totally distinct from content.
- Content is markdown. I like markdown.
- Content can me moved anywhere and built any way.
- Content is forever.
- Build process is ephemeral. If it works in ten years? Who cares? I'll swap it out with the flavor of the year.

## current build process

the current build process is next.js. it grabs the markdown files at build time and generates static html pages.
